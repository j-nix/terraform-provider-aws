# Resource: aws_ec2_transit_gateway_peering_attachment

Manages an EC2 Transit Gateway Peering Attachment, supporting the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (Ireland). For examples of custom route table association and propagation, see the EC2 Transit Gateway Networking Examples Guide.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway_peering_attachment" "example" {
  peer_account_id             = "123456789012"
  peer_region                 = "us-east-2"
  peer_transit_gateway_id     = "${aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment.example.id}"
  transit_gateway_id          = "${aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment.example.id}"

  tags = {
    Name = "Example cross-account attachment"
  }}
```

A full example of how to create a Transit Gateway in one AWS account, share it with a second AWS account, and attach a VPC in the second account to the Transit Gateway via the `aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment` resource can be found in [the `./examples/transit-gateway-cross-account-peering-attachment` directory within the Github Repository](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples/transit-gateway-cross-account-peering-attachment).
